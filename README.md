This is a game of Qix, a puzzle video game made in 1981, that I wrote in Python (pygame). The objective of the game is to color squares/areas on the game board until you have atleast 50-60% of the board covered. You must also avoid the Sparcs (orange squares) and Qix (purple square) from hitting You (blue square) and the line you are currently creating. Once you get hit 3 times and lose all your lives the game is over.

It is still a bit buggy, but should work fine for the most part.
